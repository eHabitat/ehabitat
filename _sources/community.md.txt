# Community
eHabitat is a community-driven open source project committed to host an open,
inclusive and positive community. Read the
[eHabitat Code of Conduct](https://github.com/eHabitat-devs/eHabitat/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
for guidance on how to interact with each other and make the community thrive. If you're interested in participating or if you have any inquiries regarding our archives, please get in touch with us using the provided [form 💬](https://forms.gle/1XNddvv2YxCCZuGE6)

We do this by:

* Creating and maintaining the eHabitat library with functions for posterior analysis, data storage,
  sample diagnostics, model checking, and comparison.
* Creating social infrastructure through a welcoming and diverse community
* Making the right data, tools and best practices more discoverable
* Promoting advocacy for a culture of principled iterative modeling based on the Bayesian Workflow

This page aims to gather resources related to Bayesian modeling and eHabitat from a variety of
sources to work towards the 2nd and 3rd bullet points.
This page covers how can someone participate in the eHabitat community (this someone could be you!),
gives an overview of the ecosystem of Python libraries for Bayesian analysis and serves
as a compilation for community resources around eHabitat.

*But what is the eHabitat community?*
The eHabitat community is a self-identifying group composed of probabilistic programming practitioners who,
together, contribute to the technical and social infrastructure for open and reproducible research.
Our specific focus is on Bayesian modeling and best practices that lower the barriers to working using
a fully fledged Bayesian modeling workflow, as opposed to a rigid toolbox approach.

Community members are people who use, cite and share use cases for eHabitat,
write posts or give talks about using eHabitat,
participate in issues to help define the roadmap and improve the project,
or answer questions in any of the affine forums.

This page is part of the Python eHabitat library and is therefore specific to Python,
but the eHabitat community is not restricted to Python and in fact, aims to act as a bridge
between programming languages and encourage collaboration.

# Community educational resources
eHabitat is a transversal and backend agnostic project. One can use eHabitat with _any_ PPL,
but one has to be used in order to have some data for eHabitat to analyze.
This makes writing detailed and complete documentation for eHabitat complicated.
This section aims to act as a compilation of community resources related to eHabitat
that hopefully can bridge the gap. These can be books, case studies in the documentation of
PPLs, personal blogs...

Do you know of resources about eHabitat that are not listed here? Open an issue or a PR and
let us know!
